PyTuri
======

A simple and rather fragile Python clone of the vturi
Turing machine simulator.

Installation
------------

PyTuri is designed to be used with Python 3, wich comes
pre-installed on many modern Linux distributions or can
be installed via your package manager of choice.  
Windows is neither tested nor supported but should run
mostly out of the box.

Usage
-----
   
To assemble a PyTuri source code type:

    $./turias.py lowpass.vtr lowpass.ctr

to execute the generated bytecode type:

    $./turi.py lowpass.ctr itape.tpe otape.tpe

Where itape.tpe is the input tape for the Turing machine
and otape.tpe ist the output tape of the machine.
itpe.tpe has to be created in advance, but can be an empty file.

    $touch itpe.tpe

The tape files consist of an array of Big-Endian 32 bit unsigned
integers, this is likely to change in the future as it is against
the vturi specifications.
